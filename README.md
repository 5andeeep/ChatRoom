# ChatRoom
TechStack: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Socket.io.
Purpose: I made this web app to learn web sockets. I have made a straightforward chat app to talk to my friends where we don't need any signup or login page. Just enter your name and join the chatroom.

Here we can write our name and hit the join button.

After joining we will see one chat screen

This is how it looks when more than two people chat.
